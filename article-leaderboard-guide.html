            <div class="article-content">
                <p>The "Hunt" mode is the competitive heart of the PianoMitra community. It transforms digital music practice from an isolated activity into a global competition of skill, rhythm, and creativity. While our Feed is a place for sharing and casual practice, the Leaderboard is a meritocratic ecosystem where only the most technically proficient and musically insightful tracks reach the top.</p>

                <p>To successfully compete, you need to understand two key components: the **Scoring System** (which is objective and algorithmic) and the **Verification System** (which is subjective and human-led). This guide will break down both, offering strategies on how to optimize your recorded tracks for high scores and how to earn the coveted "Official Challenge" status.</p>

                <h2>The Algorithmic Scoring System</h2>
                <p>When you record a track, PianoMitra's engine analyzes several musical data points to generate a raw **Skill Score**. This score is not based on subjective listener opinion but on objective technical difficulty and accuracy. The maximum raw score is 1000 points.</p>

                <h3>Key Scoring Metrics (Over 300 words here):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Polyphony Density (Max 300 Points):** This measures how many keys are being pressed simultaneously or in rapid succession. Tracks that utilize complex chords (7ths, 9ths, or clusters) and fast, multi-voice counterpoint score higher than simple single-note melodies. However, simply smashing keys will result in a penalty for **Tonal Dissonance**.</li>
                    <li>**Rhythm Precision (Max 300 Points):** This is the measure of how close your MIDI note onsets and offsets are to the established tempo and beat grid. We use a proprietary **quantization tolerance** algorithm. A deviation of less than 20 milliseconds from the perfect beat nets maximum points. Tracks recorded without the metronome or with highly loose timing will be heavily penalized.</li>
                    <li>**Harmonic Complexity (Max 200 Points):** The engine analyzes the relationship between the notes played. Tracks that demonstrate purposeful harmonic movement—like following the Circle of Fifths, using parallel minor keys, or implementing non-diatonic chords (borrowed chords)—are rewarded. Random or dissonant note combinations will result in a negative weighting.</li>
                    <li>**Dynamic Range (Max 100 Points):** This measures the effective use of **velocity** (how hard the keys are struck). Tracks that utilize a wide range of velocities, demonstrating expressive playing (e.g., quiet verses and loud choruses), score higher than tracks played at a uniform medium volume.</li>
                    <li>**Track Length Multiplier (Max 100 Points):** Longer, well-structured tracks receive a small bonus. A track must be at least 60 seconds long to be eligible for the full multiplier bonus, encouraging compositions over simple short loops.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>**Strategy Tip:** Focus on tight rhythm and purposeful chord voicings. A complex-sounding piece played with perfect timing will often outscore an extremely dense but sloppy track.</p>

                <h2>The Manual Verification Process: Official Challenges</h2>
                <p>To prevent system gaming (e.g., using auto-play scripts or simply creating noise), the top-scoring tracks are submitted to a human-led verification process. This step is mandatory for a track to earn the **"Official Challenge"** badge and be prominently displayed on the global Leaderboard.</p>

                <h3>The Verification Criteria:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Musicality:** Does the track sound intentional? Does it establish a key, a coherent melody, and a rhythm? Verification judges look for discernible structure (A-B-A, verse-chorus), appropriate sound design (the tone must suit the genre), and tasteful use of effects.</li>
                    <li>**Originality:** While covers are allowed, tracks demonstrating original composition and creative exploration of PianoMitra's synthesis engine are prioritized.</li>
                    <li>**Authenticity of Performance:** Tracks are reviewed to ensure they were played live (or recorded sequentially) by a human. Highly robotic, non-human velocities or unrealistic changes in dynamic range are flagged.</li>
                    <li>**Educational Value (For certain categories):** If the track is submitted to a "Theory Showcase" category, it must clearly demonstrate the theoretical concept it claims to use (e.g., a track about Lydian mode must clearly feature the raised 4th).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Only verified **Official Challenges** can be used as the basis for competitive "Hunt" submissions by other users, creating a high-quality, verified pool of challenges for the entire community.</p>

                <h2>Strategies for Consistent Leaderboard Performance </h2>
                <p>Climbing the ranks requires consistency and strategic use of the platform's tools. It’s not about one incredible track, but about a body of high-quality work.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>**Start with the Octapad:** Many top players use the **Digital Octapad** to record their rhythm section first. A perfectly quantized drum track provides the essential rhythmic foundation, making it easier to lock in the timing for the melodic and harmonic parts, which maximizes your **Rhythm Precision** score.</li>
                    <li>**Master Velocity Control:** Practice playing with the velocity sensitive keyboard mode. Instead of recording one layer at a time, consider recording chords and melody simultaneously to capture natural human dynamics. If you're a beginner, manually edit the velocity of notes after recording to increase contrast.</li>
                    <li>**Study the Top 10:** Don't just listen to the top-ranking tracks; **Replay the Data**. PianoMitra's unique data replay feature allows you to see the actual MIDI notes and timing of the top performers. Pay attention to their note density and how they transition between chords.</li>
                    <li>**Leverage Mitra Bot for Harmony:** Use the **Mitra Bot** tutor to suggest complex, non-obvious chord voicings that will increase your **Harmonic Complexity** score. Ask the bot, "Give me a secondary dominant chord progression in C minor" and then use the resulting MIDI data structure as the foundation for your track.</li>
                    <li>**Optimize for the Loop:** Even in longer tracks, focus on creating a perfect 8- or 16-bar loop that is harmonically dense and rhythmically tight. Errors in the middle of a 2-minute track can significantly reduce your overall score. Record sections and then use the loop feature to ensure perfection before stitching the parts together.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The leaderboard isn't just a display of skill; it's a testament to dedication and understanding of musical structure. By focusing on precision, complexity, and musicality, you will naturally rise in the ranks and become one of PianoMitra's most respected creators. Good luck, and happy hunting!</p>
